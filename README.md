Psydux is Modern JavaScript framework for web developers who are sick of repeating themselves with markup languages and want to build web applications with reusable functions.

The easiest way get started using the Psydux JavaScript framework is to install the command line interface. Install [node](https://nodejs.org)
first if you have not already.

Open up a terminal or command prompt and enter the following

```
npm install -g psydux-cli
```
